telemedicine with investigation imagery and results like PET scans
Faster medical image transmission. Speedy delivery of test results can be crucial for successful patient outcomes. However, MRIs and other image machines typically generate enormous files. For instance, at the Austin Cancer Center, the PET scanner generates up to 1 GB of information per patient per study. Transmitting those files on low bandwidth is highly cumbersome. Adding a 5G network to the hospital architecture can speed up the data transfer and improve both access and the quality of provided care.

Telemedicine. This market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 16.5% from 2017 to 2023. More and more healthcare providers have telemedicine programs underway, backed by government initiatives. So far, the results of such initiatives were overwhelmingly positive:

Hospital readmissions decreased by 51% for heart failure and 44% for other illnesses at Veterans Health Administration post-telemedicine adoption.
Patients enrolled in a telemedicine program were 44% less likely to be readmitted within 30 days. Additionally, 21% of patients say that the quality of the telemedicine services was similar to or higher than an in-person visit.
Beyond that, telemedicine can improve access to healthcare in the rural locations and remote locations (such as oil rigs) where no access to medical staff is readily available. With the adoption of 5G, the quality of telemedicine appointments can largely increase due to faster data exchanges and better video streaming quality. Medical professionals will also become capable of controlling medical equipment in the patient’s vicinity in real time and conduct more complex checkups remotely.

Emergency service bio-connectivity. Patient survival during prehospital time is utmost important. 5G can enable better connectivity on-the-go and allow paramedics to dispatch critical patient’s data, such as high-resolution images, high-quality video, to the hospital before their arrival.

Ambulance personnel can also hold real-time video conferencing with the hospital staff, as well as enable communication between the ambulance equipment and telemedicine tools at hospitals. All of this will result in better prehospital care.

Real-time bio connectivity through wearables. Different wearables and remote monitoring IoT devices can be given to patients to improve treatment plans and deliver preventive care. The usage of wearable health tech is expected to decrease hospital costs by 16% in the next five years.

At-home monitoring devices can be also deployed to monitor the patient’s’ vitals and schedule treatment at an optimal time (e.g., when the blood count is high enough). This would eliminate unnecessary trips to the hospital for patients. As well, medical wearables
and at-home bio-connectivity devices can be used to collect the essential health data remotely and eliminate the need for regular check-ups.

At present, however, remote monitoring technology usage is limited due to insufficient speed of data transmission and unreliable connections. 5G can change that, enabling doctors to make faster healthcare decisions and catch life-threatening health conditions earlier, even from a distance.


Wireless industrial control. 5G will enable wireless industrial control in new areas that have been previously inaccessible due to limits in latency required for smooth operations. The costly wear and tear of cables stops being a problem. Connected assembly line can be created with non-hardwired, mobile robots operating alongside with human teams. Additionally, the previously closed-loop systems that require super-fast cycle-time ranges can be made wireless.

Smart factories. Creating interconnected, efficient and semi-automatic smart factories is impossible without a strong communications architecture in place. IoT devices, robots and human personnel should be able to exchange data to collaborate effectively. With the arrival of 5G, those gadgets will no longer need to be wired to gain access to a low-latency, high-speed, high-capacity network.

Wearable technology communication. Smart helmets, glasses and other wearables are becoming more present on the manufacturing floors and in the training facilities. With 5G mobile data, the wearables become capable of delivering seamless service continuity while being away from the phone range. 5G also accelerates the speed of compute/storage delivering, meaning that all sorts of smart gadgets can go from being companion devices to robust standalone gadgets.

Ultimately, 5G will be most suited for a subset of IoT use cases requiring a combination of high data exchange rates and very low latency. New use cases will also emerge post-2020, as 5G will become more adjusted to support massive machine-type communications or ultra-reliable and low-latency communications.




Smart Grid Automation
The global demand for electricity is growing at an enormous pace. To manage the demand, new technological solutions such as smart grids and virtual power plants have emerged. Virtual Power Plants (VPP) are connected entities, aimed at optimizing the energy flow through the entire network. VPPs help owners gain maximum profit while keeping the balance of the electric network at the lowest cost available. Typically, they combine several types of resources such as solar panels, wind turbines, microgrids and energy storing installations, equipped with sensors.

5G will allow assets owners to monitor and balance the precise generation and delivery of energy in real-time, match the resources with the demand levels and create fewer emissions due to the increased efficiency. The particular advantage here is that all the transmission transactions can be instantaneous.
